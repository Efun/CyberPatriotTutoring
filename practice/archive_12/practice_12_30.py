#victory for impostors is: number of players <= number of impostors

#how do we make a cycle of killing and voting?
#how do we know how to stop the cycle?
#we want to keep killing and voting until one of our win conditions is met

#this is a while loop!
#what's going to be the condition or the thing that stops the while loop?
#our stoppers for the while loop are just going to be our victory conditions!

players = []

while 

while True:
    #this happens forever until break

    #if some condition here:
        #do something
        break

    #if some other condition here:
        #do something
        break


#approach for doing this one is to have a bunch of boolean variables for the win conditions
#we continue the loop until one of those boolean variables gets changed to false
#we use the and operator between these booleans as the condition for our loop
while someCondition:
    #do something here

    #this while loop will execute until the condition at the top evaluates to false
